                    Javed Akhtar (b. 1990, Kolkata, India) is an artist currently lives and works between Margate and
                    London, UK.
                    Javed primarily works in painting, exploring it as a contemporary tool to document and interpret
                    socio-political and environmental challenges. Through his practice, he seeks to capture the
                    complexities of human experience—anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and the mysteries of life and
                    death—using a style that merges realism with a touch of the magical. For Javed, painting is both a
                    means of self-consolation and a journey of self-discovery, where the process often holds more
                    significance than the finished piece.
